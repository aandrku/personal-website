# Hello! I'm Andrii.

Welcome to my little corner on the Internet, where I write things about computers,
tech, development and other. Hello



## My goals

I do not work professionally (yet). This is my main goal right now - to become a developer.
Programming is my passion. I like writing Go and can tolerate TypeScript.
My interest lies in everything a programmer can do. I'd love to learn about games, 
graphics, systems, IoT, programming languages and more. That said, I think that for now it would smart
to focus on web development with Go and TypeScript, until I can find a good job to support 
my exploration of computer world.

## Social media

You can find me on Github, Linkedin and Discord.
