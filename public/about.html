I'm Andrii.</h2>
<p>Welcome to my little corner on the Internet, where I write things about computers,
tech, development and other.</p>
<h2>My goals</h2>
<p>I do not work professionally (yet). This is my main goal right now - to become a developer.
Programming is my passion. I like writing Go and can tolerate TypeScript.
My interest lies in everything a programmer can do. I'd love to learn about games,
graphics, systems, IoT, programming languages and more. That said, I think that for now it would smart
to focus on web development with Go and TypeScript, until I can find a good job to support
my exploration of computer world.</p>
<h2>Social media</h2>
<p>You can find me on Github, Linkedin and Discord.</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>Feel free to reach out to me, I would be happy to answer all your emails at andriisozonik@gmail.com.</p>
